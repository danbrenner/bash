# Useful rsync commands

# rsync via SSH in archive mode, preserving permissions and timestamps and allow resuming partial files
rsync -avzPe ssh user@source_server:/path/to/source/ user@destination_server:/path/to/destination/

# rsync a file in place (no temporary file) via SSH, allowing partial resume and showing progress
# (this is very useful for "streaming" a movie without having to wait for the entire download)
rsync -P -e --inplace ssh user@source_server:/path/to/source/ user@destination_server:/path/to/destination/
