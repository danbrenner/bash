# Useful grep commands

# tail logfile.log continuously, pipe its output to ggrep (basically PCRE grep for OS X) 
# with options (P = PCRE mode, o = only return match, a = process even binary data as text),
# and match any continuous numeric value that's in between the _BORDER_ patterns...
# this is useful for targeting IDs line by line in logs to trigger some action.
tail -F logfile.log | ggrep -Poa '_LEFT_BORDER_PATTERN_\K\d+(?=_RIGHT_BORDER_PATTERN_)'
